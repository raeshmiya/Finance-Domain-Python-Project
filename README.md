## üß† What I Did

- Collected and cleaned raw loan data using Pandas for structured analysis.
- Calculated essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including:
- Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, Average DTI, and Good vs Bad Loan metrics.
- Conducted Month-to-Date (MTD) and overall performance analysis.
- Created multiple visualizations to uncover insights:
  - Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line / Area Chart)
  - Regional Distribution by State (Bar Chart)
  - Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)
  - Employment Length and Loan Purpose Analysis (Bar Charts)
  - Home Ownership Impact (Tree / Heat Map)
- Generated comprehensive visual reports in Jupyter Notebook, combining analysis and visual storytelling.

## üìàHighlights

- All analysis, KPI computation, and reporting were done entirely in Python ‚Äî no external BI tools used.
- Focused on data transformation, visualization, and insight generation.
- Visual outputs effectively highlight trends, regional patterns, and borrower behavior insights.
